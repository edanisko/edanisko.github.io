Chapter 4: Introduction to HTML5 for Game Development

In this chapter, we will introduce the HTML5 canvas element and show how it can be used for game development in JavaScript.

The HTML5 canvas element is a blank area on a web page that can be used to draw graphics using JavaScript. To create a canvas element, we can use the following code:

Copy code
<canvas id="game" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
This code creates a canvas element with the id "game" and a width and height of 800 and 600 pixels, respectively.

To access the canvas element in JavaScript, we can use the following code:

Copy code
var canvas = document.getElementById("game");
This code gets a reference to the canvas element with the id "game" and assigns it to the variable "canvas".

Once we have a reference to the canvas element, we can use it to draw graphics using JavaScript. For example, the following code uses the "fillRect" method to draw a red rectangle on the canvas:

Copy code
var canvas = document.getElementById("game");
var context = canvas.getContext("2d");

context.fillStyle = "red";
context.fillRect(100, 100, 50, 50);
In the next chapter, we will cover more advanced topics in HTML5 and JavaScript and provide examples of how to use them for game development.

Chapter 3: Basic Metal Programming

In this chapter, we will learn the basics of Metal programming, including how to create a Metal device, command queue, and command buffer, and how to submit commands for execution on the GPU. We will also cover the basic structure of a Metal program, including the metal shading language and the Metal Performance Shaders framework.

3.1: Creating a Metal Device and Command Queue

A Metal device is an object that represents the iPhone's graphics hardware, and is the starting point for all Metal programming. A Metal command queue is an object that manages the execution of commands on the GPU. To create a Metal device and command queue:

Import the Metal framework into your project.

Create a Metal device object by calling the MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() function.

Create a Metal command queue object by calling the makeCommandQueue() method on the Metal device object.

Use the Metal command queue object to submit commands for execution on the GPU.

3.2: Creating a Metal Command Buffer

A Metal command buffer is an object that holds a list of commands to be executed on the GPU. To create a Metal command buffer:

Import the Metal framework into your project.

Create a Metal command buffer object by calling the makeCommandBuffer() method on the Metal command queue object.

Use the Metal command buffer object to add commands to the command queue for execution on the GPU.

3.3: Submitting Commands for Execution on the GPU

Once you have added commands to the Metal command buffer, you can submit them for execution on the GPU. To submit commands for execution:

Import the Metal framework into your project.

Create a Metal command buffer object and add commands to it.

Call the commit() method on the Metal command buffer object to submit the commands for execution on the GPU.

Call the waitUntilCompleted() method on the Metal command buffer object to wait for the commands to complete execution on the GPU.

3.4: The Structure of a Metal Program

A Metal program consists of several components, including the metal shading language, the Metal Performance Shaders framework, and the MetalKit framework.

The metal shading language is a low-level, low-overhead programming language that is specifically designed for writing shaders for the GPU. Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU and are responsible for rendering graphics and performing other compute-intensive tasks.

The Metal Performance Shaders framework is a collection of high-level, optimized compute and graphics functions that are built on top of the Metal framework. It provides developers with a convenient and easy-to-use API for accessing the full power of the GPU, without the need to write low-level shader code.

The MetalKit framework is a collection of classes and functions that are designed to make it easier to develop Metal-based apps and games. It provides support for common game development tasks such as loading 3D models, handling input, and more.

3.5: Code Examples

Here are two code examples to illustrate the basics of Metal programming:

Creating a Metal Device and Command Queue: In this code example, we will show how to create a Metal device and command queue and submit commands for execution on the GPU:
Copy code
import Metal

// Create a Metal device object by calling the MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() function
let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

// Create a Metal command queue object by calling the makeCommandQueue() method on the Metal device object
let commandQueue = device.makeCommandQueue()

// Create a Metal command buffer object by calling the makeCommandBuffer() method on the Metal command queue object
let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer()

// Add commands to the command buffer
// ...

// Submit the commands for execution on the GPU by calling the commit() method on the Metal command buffer object
commandBuffer.commit()

// Wait for the commands to complete execution on the GPU by calling the waitUntilCompleted() method on the Metal command buffer object
commandBuffer.waitUntilCompleted()
The Structure of a Metal Program: In this code example, we will show the basic structure of a Metal program, including the use of the metal shading language and the Metal Performance Shaders framework:
Copy code
import Metal
import MetalKit
import MetalPerformanceShaders

// Create a Metal device object
let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

// Create a Metal command queue object
let commandQueue = device.makeCommandQueue()

// Create a Metal command buffer object
let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer


Here are two more code examples to illustrate the basics of Metal programming, including the use of the metal shading language and the Metal Performance Shaders framework:

Using the metal Shading Language: In this code example, we will show how to use the metal shading language to create a simple vertex shader that transforms a 3D model's vertices from model space to clip space:
Copy code
// Define the metal shading language vertex function
vertex float4 vertex_shader(constant float4x4 model_view_projection_matrix [[buffer(0)]],
                            const device float3 *vertices [[buffer(1)]],
                            uint vid [[vertex_id]])
{
    // Transform the vertex from model space to clip space
    return model_view_projection_matrix * float4(vertices[vid], 1.0);
}
Using the Metal Performance Shaders Framework: In this code example, we will show how to use the Metal Performance Shaders framework to create a simple convolution operation on a 2D image:
Copy code
// Import the MetalPerformanceShaders framework
import MetalPerformanceShaders

// Create a Metal device object
let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

// Create a Metal command queue object
let commandQueue = device.makeCommandQueue()

// Create a Metal command buffer object
let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer()

// Create a Metal texture object for the input image
let inputTexture = ...

// Create a Metal texture object for the output image
let outputTexture = ...

// Create a Metal library object
let library = device.makeDefaultLibrary()

// Create a Metal compute pipeline state object for the convolution operation
let convolutionPipelineState = try? device.makeComputePipelineState(function: library.makeFunction(name: "convolution_kernel")!)

// Create a Metal compute command encoder object
let computeCommandEncoder = commandBuffer.makeComputeCommandEncoder()

// Set the compute pipeline state on the compute command encoder
computeCommandEncoder.setComputePipelineState(convolutionPipelineState)

// Set the input and output textures on the compute command encoder
computeCommandEncoder.setTexture(inputTexture, index: 0)
computeCommandEncoder.setTexture(outputTexture, index: 1)

// Dispatch the compute kernel
let threadGroupCount = MTLSize(width: inputTexture.width, height: inputTexture.height, depth: 1)
let threadGroups = MTLSize(width: (inputTexture.width + convolutionPipelineState.threadExecutionWidth - 1) / convolutionPipelineState.threadExecutionWidth, height: (inputTexture.height + convolutionPipelineState.maxTotalThreadsPerThreadgroup - 1) / convolutionPipelineState.maxTotalThreadsPerThreadgroup, depth: 1)
computeCommandEncoder.dispatchThreadgroups(threadGroups, threadsPerThreadgroup: threadGroupCount)

// End the compute command encoder
computeCommandEncoder.

To finish this chapter, we will cover a few more important concepts in Metal programming.

3.6: The Metal Shading Language

The metal shading language is a low-level, low-overhead programming language that is specifically designed for writing shaders for the GPU. Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU and are responsible for rendering graphics and performing other compute-intensive tasks.

The metal shading language is based on the C++ programming language, and provides a familiar syntax and features such as functions, variables, control structures, and more. It also includes specific features and constructs for working with graphics and compute-intensive tasks, such as vertex and fragment functions, texture access, and more.

3.7: The Metal Performance Shaders Framework

The Metal Performance Shaders framework is a collection of high-level, optimized compute and graphics functions that are built on top of the Metal framework. It provides developers with a convenient and easy-to-use API for accessing the full power of the GPU, without the need to write low-level shader code.

The Metal Performance Shaders framework includes a wide range of functions for common graphics and compute operations, such as image processing, filtering, convolution, mathematical operations, and more. It also includes support for common data structures and algorithms, such as matrices, vectors, and quaternions, and provides performance optimizations such as parallel execution and SIMD instructions.

3.8: Next Steps

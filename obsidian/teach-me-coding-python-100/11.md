Chapter 11: Functional Programming in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for functional programming and how to use it to write concise and elegant code.

Python is a versatile programming language that supports several programming paradigms, including functional programming. Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to write concise and elegant code.

To illustrate the basics of functional programming in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to define a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the square of each number in the input list. We can define this function like this:

```python
def square_numbers(numbers):
    return [n ** 2 for n in numbers]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = square_numbers(numbers)
print(squares)
```

In this code, we define the square_numbers() function that takes a numbers list as an input and returns a new list with the square of each number in the input list. We use a list comprehension to create the new list, which is a concise and elegant way of defining a new list by applying a transformation to each element in an existing list.

To use this function, we create a numbers list and call the square_numbers() function, passing the numbers list as an argument. The function returns a new squares list with the squares of each number in the input list, and we print the squares list to the screen. The output should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25], which is the expected result.

Another important aspect of functional programming is the use of pure functions. A pure function is a function that always returns the same result for the same input, and has no side effects (i.e. it does not modify any external variables or produce any output). This allows us to reason about our code more easily, because we can be sure that a pure function will always produce the same result for the same input, and we don't need to worry about external factors that may affect its behavior.

To illustrate the use of pure functions, let's consider another example where we want to define a function that checks if a number is prime. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by 1 and itself, and we can define a pure function that checks if a number is prime like this:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False

    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    return True

print(is_prime(1))
print(is_prime(2))
print(is_prime(3))
print(is_prime(4))
print(is_prime(5))
```

In this code, we define the is_prime() function that takes a number n as an input and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise. The function uses a simple algorithm that checks if the number is less than or equal to 1 (in which case it is not prime), and then checks if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 to n - 1. If the number is not divisible by any of these integers, it is prime and the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

To test the is_prime() function, we call it with different numbers and print the results to the screen. The output should be False, True, True, False, True, which is the expected result.

In addition to pure functions, functional programming also emphasizes the use of higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return other functions as results. This allows us to write more concise and elegant code by defining generic functions that can operate on a wide range of inputs, and by abstracting common patterns and operations into reusable functions.

To illustrate the use of higher-order functions, let's consider another example where we want to define a function that takes a list of numbers and a function, and applies the function to each number in the list. We can define this function like this:

```python
def apply_function(numbers, func):
    return [func(n) for n in numbers]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = apply_function(numbers, lambda x: x ** 2)
print(squares)
```

In this code,we define the apply_function() function that takes a numbers list and a func function as inputs and returns a new list with the result of applying the func function to each number in the numbers list. We use a list comprehension to create the new list, which is a concise and elegant way of defining a new list by applying a transformation to each element in an existing list.

To use this function, we create a numbers list and call the apply_function() function, passing the numbers list and an anonymous lambda function that squares each number as arguments. The apply_function() function returns a new squares list with the squares of each number in the input list, and we print the squares list to the screen. The output should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25], which is the expected result.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python's support for data analysis and how to use it to perform data analysis tasks in Python.

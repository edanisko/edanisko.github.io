## Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for object-oriented programming and how to use it to write modular and reusable code.

Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts allow us to write modular and reusable code by organizing our code into logical units and defining the relationships between these units.

To illustrate the basics of object-oriented programming in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to define a Person class with a name attribute and a greet() method that prints a greeting to the screen. We can define the Person class like this:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is {}".format(self.name))
```

In this code, we define the Person class with a __init__() method that takes a name parameter and sets it as an attribute of the object, and a greet() method that prints a greeting message to the screen.

To use this class, we can create a Person object and call the greet() method:

```python
p = Person("John")
p.greet()
```

In this code, we create a Person object with the name "John" and store it in the p variable. We then call the greet() method of the p object, which will print the greeting message "Hello, my name is John" to the screen.

One of the key benefits of object-oriented programming is the ability to create subclasses that inherit the attributes and methods of a parent class. For example, we can define a Student subclass that inherits from the Person class and adds a study() method:

```python
class Student(Person):
    def study(self):
        print("{} is studying".format(self.name))

s = Student("Jane")
s.greet()
s.study()
```

In this code, we define the Student class that inherits from the Person class using the class keyword and the parent class name in parentheses. The Student class has all the attributes and methods of the Person class, as well as the additional study() method that we define. We then create a Student object and call the greet() and study() methods, which will print the appropriate messages to the screen.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python's support for functional programming and how to use it to write concise and elegant code.

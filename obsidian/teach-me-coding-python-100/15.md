## Chapter 15: Scientific Computing in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for scientific computing and how to use it to perform scientific computing tasks in Python.

Python is a popular language for scientific computing, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support a wide range of scientific computing tasks. Some of the most popular libraries for scientific computing in Python include NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy, which provide powerful tools for working with arrays, numerical computation, and symbolic mathematics, respectively.

To illustrate the basics of scientific computing in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to solve a simple system of linear equations. We can do this using the NumPy and SciPy libraries like this:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import linalg

# Define the system of equations
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
b = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Solve the system of equations
x = linalg.solve(A, b)

# Print the solution
print(x)
```

In this code, we import the NumPy and SciPy libraries and give them short aliases (np and linalg, respectively). We then define a simple system of linear equations, where A is a 3x3 matrix and b is a 3x1 vector.

Next, we use the solve() function from SciPy's linalg module to solve the system of equations and store the solution in the x variable. Finally, we print the solution to the screen. The output should be [-1.23e-15 1.00e+00 -1.00e+00], which is the expected result.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python's support for game development and how to use it to build games in Python.

## Chapter 4: Classes and Objects in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about classes and objects in Python, and how to use them to model real-world concepts and create more complex programs.

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors. To define a class, we use the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, we define the attributes and methods (functions) of the class. For example, we can define a Car class with the attributes color and speed and a drive() method that sets the speed of the car:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color, speed):
        self.color = color
        self.speed = speed
    
    def drive(self, speed):
        self.speed = speed
```

To create an object of a class, we use the class name followed by the arguments for the __init__() method in parentheses. For example, we can create a red_car object with a starting speed of 0 and a blue_car object with a starting speed of 50 like this:


```python
red_car = Car("red", 0)
blue_car = Car("blue", 50)
```
To access the attributes and methods of an object, we use the dot notation. For example, we can access the color and speed of the red_car object like this:

```python
print(red_car.color)
print(red_car.speed)
```

We can also call the methods of an object. For example, we can call the drive() method of the blue_car object to set its speed to 100 like this:

```python
blue_car.drive(100)
print(blue_car.speed)
```

In this code, the output for the last print() statement will be 100, because we set the speed of the blue_car to 100 using the drive() method.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn more advanced concepts in Python, such as error handling and file input/output.

## Chapter 17: Automation in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for automation and how to use it to automate tasks in Python.

Python is a popular language for automation, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support a wide range of automation tasks. Some of the most popular libraries for automation in Python include Fabric, Ansible, and SaltStack, which provide powerful tools for automating the deployment, configuration, and management of systems and applications.

To illustrate the basics of automation in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to automate the creation of a directory and the copying of a file to that directory. We can do this using the os and shutil modules from the standard Python library like this:

```python
import os
import shutil

# Create a directory
os.mkdir("my_dir")

# Copy a file to the directory
shutil.copy("my_file.txt", "my_dir/my_file.txt")
```

In this code, we import the os and shutil modules from the standard Python library. We then use the mkdir() function from the os module to create a directory called my_dir, and the copy() function from the shutil module to copy a file called my_file.txt to the my_dir directory.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python's support for parallel computing and how to use it to perform parallel computing tasks in Python.

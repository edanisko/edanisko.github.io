## Chapter 18: Parallel Computing in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for parallel computing and how to use it to perform parallel computing tasks in Python.

Python is a popular language for parallel computing, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support a wide range of parallel computing tasks. Some of the most popular libraries for parallel computing in Python include Dask, Joblib, and concurrent.futures, which provide powerful tools for parallelizing computations and leveraging the power of multicore and distributed systems.

To illustrate the basics of parallel computing in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to parallelize the computation of the factorial of a large number. We can do this using the concurrent.futures module from the standard Python library like this:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def factorial(n):
    # Compute the factorial of a number
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Create a process pool executor
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    # Submit a factorial task to the executor
    result = executor.submit(factorial, 1000000)

    # Get the result of the task
    print(result.result())
```

In this code, we define a factorial() function that computes the factorial of a given number using a simple loop. We then create a ProcessPoolExecutor object and use it to submit a task that computes the factorial of a large number (1000000).

The ProcessPoolExecutor automatically parallelizes the task using multiple processes, and we can use the result() method of the returned Future object to get the result of the computation. The output of this code should be the correct result of the factorial computation, which is a very large number.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python's support for artificial intelligence and how to use it to build AI applications in Python.

## Chapter 19: Artificial Intelligence in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for artificial intelligence and how to use it to build AI applications in Python.

Python is a popular language for artificial intelligence, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support a wide range of AI tasks. Some of the most popular libraries for AI in Python include TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, which provide powerful tools for building and training machine learning models, as well as natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI applications.

To illustrate the basics of AI in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to build and train a simple machine learning model to classify images of hand-written digits. We can do this using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Load the dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1))
X_train = X_train.astype("float32") / 255

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
_, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("Test accuracy: {:.2f}".format(acc))
```

In this code, we import the TensorFlow and Keras libraries and give them short aliases (`tf` and `layers`, respectively). We then define a simple convolutional neural network using the `Sequential` model from Keras, which consists of a series of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

Next, we compile the model using the `compile()` method, specifying the optimizer and loss function to use during training. We then load the MNIST dataset using the built-in `load_data()` function from Keras and preprocess the training data by reshaping it to the correct shape and scaling the pixel values to the range [0, 1].

Finally, we train the model using the `fit()` method, specifying the training data and the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset). We then evaluate the model on the test data using the `evaluate()` method and print the test accuracy to the screen.

That's it for this chapter! In this course, we have covered the basics of Python programming, including data types, control flow, functions, modules, and many other topics. We have also seen how Python can be used for a variety of tasks, such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more.

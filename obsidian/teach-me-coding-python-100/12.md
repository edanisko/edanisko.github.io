## Chapter 12: Data Analysis in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for data analysis and how to use it to perform data analysis tasks in Python.

Python is a popular language for data analysis, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support a wide range of data analysis tasks. Some of the most popular libraries for data analysis in Python include NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which provide powerful tools for working with arrays, data frames, and visualizations, respectively.

To illustrate the basics of data analysis in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to load a dataset from a CSV file, compute some basic statistics, and visualize the data. We can do this using the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries like this:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")

# Compute some basic statistics
mean = df["column"].mean()
median = df["column"].median()
std = df["column"].std()

# Visualize the data
plt.hist(df["column"])
plt.show()
```

In this code, we import the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries and give them short aliases (np, pd, and plt, respectively). We then use the read_csv() function from Pandas to load the dataset from a CSV file and store it in a data frame (df).

Next, we use the Pandas DataFrame class to compute some basic statistics of the data, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of a column in the data frame. Finally, we use the Matplotlib hist() function to visualize the data as a histogram, and the show() function to display the histogram.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python

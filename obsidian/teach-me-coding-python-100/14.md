## Chapter 14: Web Development in Python

In this chapter, we will learn about Python's support for web development and how to use it to build web applications in Python.

Python is a popular language for web development, with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that support a wide range of web development tasks. Some of the most popular libraries for web development in Python include Flask, Django, and Pyramid, which provide powerful tools for building and deploying web applications.

To illustrate the basics of web development in Python, let's consider a simple example where we want to build a simple web application that displays a greeting message to the user. We can do this using the Flask library like this:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, world!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

In this code, we import the Flask library and create a Flask app object. We then define a simple route that maps the "/" URL to the hello() function, which returns the greeting message "Hello, world!".

Finally, we use the run() method of the Flask app to start the web server and run the application. When we access the "/" URL in a web browser, the hello() function will be called and the greeting message will be displayed.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn about Python's support for scientific computing and how to use it to perform scientific computing tasks in Python.
